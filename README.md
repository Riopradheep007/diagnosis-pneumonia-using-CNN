### Overview
   Diagnosis pneumonia based on the x-ray images of the patient.X-ray image have to upload in the web app.Backend my deep Learning model is there
**CNN** model will able to classify pneumonia affected images correctly.
   
### Motivation
  Build a CNN model is very much easy with the help of tensorflow library.But the inportant thing is model have to classify correctly.After undenstanding indepth mathematics behind the Deep Learning i decided to bulid one complete END-to-END project.In this pandemic time i choose this dataset from kaggle.Whwn  i was started doing this project i had faced many problem to my  this model.so 




### Technical Aspect

       
### Installation
