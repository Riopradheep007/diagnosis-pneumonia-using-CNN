### Overview
   Diagnosis pneumonia based on the x-ray images of the patient.X-ray image have to upload in the web app.Backend my deep Learning model is there
**CNN** model will able to classify pneumonia affected images correctly.
   
### Motivation
   Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.Doctor by seeing the
x-ray image of the patient  diagnosis pneumonia.By seeing x-ray images to identify pneumonia is not thats much accurate and it take some time to diagnosis even for a experience doctors.Some of the undeveloped countries doctors are less to fix.To this problem i build this model.By uploading images with in a second my model with classify  the pneumonia.



### Technical Aspect

        Data was colleced from  kaggle.
        pre-process was done with the help of libraries.
        CNN model was build to diagnosis pneumonia.
   

          

       
### Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
### Run
Torun this model In Linux/Mac open Terminal.If you are Windows user open your command prompt.Run the command 

    python app.py
